shh...

k so for the new evade there's gonna be 3 new ideas
- story
- bossfights
- megaObstacles

A megaObstacle is basically a set of obstacles that changes the game in a significant way. For example, think of time travel or obstacles in 3d.

The story is very generic, as we want the game to feel big and we want to have room to design the game around it.

Story
- you're fighting god (different name pending, it could be some demon or something)
    - god is the creator of the universes (number of universes isnt specified)
- you were living a normal life until your planet got destroyed and only you and a few other crewmates (explanation for multiplayer) survived
    - you have to fight god through many universes (bossfight at the end) to save the universe.

Megaobstacle ideas:
- 2d layers that you can swap between
- 3d
- time travel
- warping space (ex. rendering a level onto a cone)
- posession and miniplanets - like angry birds mini planets and posession (you control) of certain obstacles if you run into them or event is triggered

Universes

Universe 1
MegaObstacle: none - This is the introduction to the game. We don't want to throw any megaobstacles as the player yet as we mostly need to teach the player what to expect before throwing in the unexpected.
Relation to story: You meet god and stumble into his first trap. He doesn't see you as a threat, though, and doesn't focus too much on you.
Bossfight: As this is the world where we introduce players into the expected, the boss should be exactly what is expected. It is a separate planet that has a simple boss with a few attacks and some buffs at half hp.
Notes: We should only have around 15-20 obstacles in the first world to make the game seem really small. We want players to really be shocked later, so only non-special whg-style obstacles should be present. Probably only normal enemies or no enemies at all should be present in this unvierse. Planet of settings will also be here.

Universe 2
MegaObstacle: recursion, clones, (and time warping, but this one is less significant) - recursion: like patrick's parabox, you can have "map boxes" that can be entered, given some condition (varies between obstacle types). Clones: multiple types of clones, some that can affect the players if they get affected (ex. if they hit a speed change then you also go faster even though you're not on that speed change) and others that can't. Also, there can be obstacles that interact with clones, making puzzle maps and minigames much more versitile. Time warping: basically time travel except time can go slower or faster, opening the door to a variety of time-themed obstacles and global props. This simulates ticks at a faster / slower rate but it still looks smooth because it's interpolated. Also save obstacle that saves the current state and then undo obstacle to undo to that current state.
Relation to story: God has some tricks. He still doesn't think you're too much of a threat so this universe is more of a magic show to slow you down rather than a trying challenge.
Bossfight: The boss uses all three mechanics in tandem to create some high difficult challenges. 2 clones have to simultaneously dodge enemies in 2 identical boxes, recursion is used to access the area needed to damage the boss, and time is slowed at every phase of the fight. There are 3 phases and the boss emphasizes 1 of the 3 mechanics the most in each phase. After all 3 phases are defeated, there's a final minute of surivival that combines all 3 all at once.
Notes: Enemies should be fully introduced in this universe as well as some global systems (speficially those to do with enemies) like parenting, server sided obstacles, and decorations. Also, editor should be introed in this uni or uni 1.

Universe 3 (3 for 3d)
MegaObstacle: 3d - This is universe 3, let's introduce 3d! 3d is like that featured in semioldevade's po3d, although we will have 2d sections like how super mario odyessy does it. The hub will start out with a 2d section with the 3d camera fixed on it, but exiting any side will lead to the player 
Relation to story: Not all universes are 2d! God is beginning to try harder and making things a lot more difficult.
Bossfight: black hole boss and some fancy animation in 3d. I don't wanna plan much else out because i don't know what will be possible.
Notes: We need some way for adding 2d obstacles to automatically add a 3d counterpart. We can have 3d specific obstacles, although those converted from 2d to 3d will literally just be prisms of their 2d counterpart (with a depth parameter automatically added).

Universe 4
MegaObstacle: game modes - This universe will have a strong emphasis on different challenges, as it is a skill test. Game modes like florr (waves), tag (tagpro), and iframes should be added here, although these mechanics will only be the focus of like 2 planets. The other planets in this universe will be basically very hard modern whg.
Relation to story: The spike. God starts to pay attention to you specifically and goes all out. This universe is the first skill test and check's the player's ability to perform literally everything. A galaxy (super long planet) is required to complete the uni.
Bossfight: This boss is ready for all things. This boss can predict your movements and throws a lot of minigames/microgames at you.
Notes: Many other global systems such as the event system, the connection system, and spawners should be introduced. If possible, custom client themes can also be introduced and npcs for sure should be added by this time, although we can do it earlier. Different player shapes should probably be done earlier but at the latest it should be supported here.

Story will be told through gameplay and gameplay only! There will be "cutscenes" but they'll all be playable and you can die in most of them.
We can literally make these cutscenes maps.

VFX
Ex should really focus on visual impressions a lot. These are some of the places where we will have a lot of vfx.
- Winroom
    - whenever you win a level for the first time, there should be a light burst of confetti like how quizlet or yt does it.
    - More juicy effects if you beat a difficulty that you haven't beaten for the first time
- Cutscenes
    - lots of epic particle effects and just a bunch of eye candy in general
